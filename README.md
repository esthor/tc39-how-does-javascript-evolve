## What Will We Learn?

## Who Am I?

Script kid - IRC, bots, XTech, et-networks, Democratic Party & business simulator, making local government easier, DoD, DARPA & NSF thrice, EU, ERC, SRC, CEO, backed by largest green VC in EU, — 

Titles and Names don’t matter. Ideas and persistent interest matter.

Teaching - Statistics, Startups, Design (Sketch), Software Development (React & React Native), Machine Learning (UNF), Guitar

OSS Normie - [swipeable list](https://github.com/esthor/react-native-swipeable-list), random commits, oh-my-zsh maintainer

19k downloads/month :money_printer: -- but seriously, consider donating time (or money) to open source. [Babel is a good one](https://opencollective.com/babel).

## History of JavaScript

See a talk I gave in 2019 on ["The Future of UI" (Spoiler: It's written in ReasonML)](https://github.com/esthor/future-of-ui)
Netscape, Marc Andreeson, Brendan Eich and last minute "we should have interactivity in these documents" product requirement
OG Name, Java:tm: branding, ECMA
The Period of Great Evils from Redmond: Microsoft, IE, JScript and the death of ES4

## ECMA aka Ecma International

What is it? What was it?
What other things do they standardize?
(JSON, Dart, C#, NFC, and just a bunch of technology related standards)

## Naming is hard

ECMA -> Ecma International
LiveScript -> JavaScript -> ECMAScript -> ES6 -> ES2022

## TC39
